							<h3> Introduction to the LSST Solar System Readiness Sprint </h3>
							
 							 <p> The Sprint is designed to be different than some of the other meetings you've attended. The Sprint is designed to be as interactive. The idea to spend some dedicated time to think about Rubin Observatory
								 and LSST Solar System data products and carve out some time to try and kickstart some activities that you can carry forward during the year. There will be some talks, discussion sessions, and project time.  On the second day of the workshop, 
								 atteendees will pitch projects. It's okay if you don't have a project idea, some people with pitch ideas looking for help. So there will be ways you can get involved during the Sprint. </p>
							
							
							<h3> Remote Participation and Communications </h3>
							<p> We will be streaming and recording the talks for those who cannot attend in person. We will post the recordings online as quickly as possible.</p>
						
							<h3> COVID-19 Protocols and Masking Policy</h3>
							<p> We are following local guidelines for COVID-19. Masking is not required, but we ask all attendees to respect any antendee's decision to weark a mask during the Sprint. We ask if you have any COVID-like symptoms to please test before coming and wear a N95, KN95, KF94, or FFP2  masks (or their equivalents) while attending the Sprint. The organizers will provide these masks for free for any who need them and will have a 
							 small number of lateral flow tests available for attendees.  If you do test positive for COVID-19 during or shortly after the meeting, please do let the organizers know so we can make attendees aware about the possible exposure. </p>

							
							<h3> Code of Conduct </h3>
							<p> All attendees have agreed to and are expected to follow the Meeting Code of Conduct at all times. A copy of the Sprint Code fo Conduct can be found <a href='https://lsst-sssc.github.io/Sprint2024/code_of_conduct.html'>here</a>. </p>  

							<h3> Venue </h3>
							<p> The Sprint will be hosted at the University of Oxford in the UK. This is our first Sprint outside of the US. Further details about the meeting spaces will be availble closer to September. </p>

							<h3> Accomodation </h3>
							<p> There are very limited number of hotels in Oxford close to the University campus and city centre. We recommend staying in accomodation at the local colleges that make up Oxford University. We are in the process
							of getting an accomodation block of ensuite rooms in one of the colleges close to the Oxford Physics Department/Astrophysics subdepartment. We will post the information once it becomes available in the next few weeks.
								<!-- If you prefer to stay elsewhere, you can try the <a href="https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/oxford/home/">University Bookings</a> system
						        or <a href="https://www.club.ox.ac.uk/non-member-booking">the University Club </a>. --> </p>
							
							<h3> Getting to Oxford </h3>
							<p> Plane: Oxford is a 1 hour to 1.5 hour bus ride away from London Heathrow Airport and ~2-2.5 hours from Gatwick Airport. We recommend taking the <a href="https://www.theairlineoxford.co.uk/"> airliner bus</a> (which has pickups and stops at the Heathrow Central Bus Station,  Heathrow Terminal 5 (stand 10), and Gatwick North and South Terminal) to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GkMe567PDV6y4frG9"> Gloucester Green bus station </a> (last stop of the bus route in Oxford). Tickets can be bought on the bus or via the bus
								company's mobile app. A timetable can be found <a href="https://www.theairlineoxford.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Airline-summer-2023-A4-timetable-V6-1.pdf">here</a>. </p>
							<p> Train: By train, the Department of Physics/Astrophysics subdepartment is a 15-20-minute walk from the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3VuDWoXHBMXxV5Uc9"> Oxford train station</a>. For further details about the train schedule, please check out the <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/oxford/">station website</a>. </p>

							<h3> What do you mean by project? </h3>
							<p> A project can be a wide variety of things, spanning everything from exploring the simulated LSST Solar System database, writing a paper/white paper/AAS Research note draft,  brainstorming a funding proposal idea, learning a new tool, software development, drafting an observing proposal, etc. Basically 
								anything that is going to help you get ready for Day 1 of LSST. We'll have time during Day 1 to brainstorm project ideas, and on Day 2, we'll have time for everyone who wants to lead a project to pitch their project. It's totally okay if you don't have a project idea. If you don't have a project in mind that's okay too, you can join one or more of the projects that are pitched on Day 2. The goal is to get together and spend a few dedicated days making something or learning a new skill that will help get you ready for LSST data. </p>
							</p>
						
						       
						       <h3> What are Unconference Sessions? </h3>
						
							<p> These are dedicated timeslots without a set agenda; participants will decide what is to be discussed/presented on the day of. This could be a discussion, debate, demo,tutorial, etc. Topics will be pitched and then voted on. The top three or four topics will be assigned rooms. If you have a discussion topic you want to bring up at the consortium meeting, this is the best way to do it. </p>

							<h3> What are lightning talks?</h3>
							<p> A lightning talk is a 2-3 minute talk on whatever you want to share with Sprint attendees. It could be advertising a new software package, paper, research result. Anything you think is of interest. In the lightning session, for each talk you can post 1 slide and will be given 2-3 minutes to present the slide. You can sign up for a lightning talk through the registration form. </p>
							
							<h3> I'm new to the SSSC and/or the LSST Solar System Readiness Sprints </h3>
							<p> Check out our <href="https://lsst-sssc.github.io/Sprint2024/day0.html">Day 0 page</> which has some videos to help get you up to speed </p> 
							
						
							<h3> Is there a primer of the expected LSST/Rubin Observatory Solar System Data Products </h3>
							<p> Yes, take a look at the SSSC's <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/dataProds.html">data products webpage </a>, and watch the talk below on Rubin Observatory Data Products </a> from last year's virtual Sprint. </p>
