							<h3> What is Day -1?</h3>
							<p> Day -1 is this webpage. This page is a guide to all the things about the Sprint organization, schedule, and tools we'll be using. </p>
								
							<h3> Introduction to the LSST Solar System Readiness Sprint </h3>
							
 							 <p> The Sprint is designed to be different than some of the other meetings you've attended. The Sprint is designed to be as interactive as we can make it in a virtual setting. The idea to spend some dedicated time to think about Rubin Observatory
								 and LSST Solar System data products and carve out some time to try and kickstart some activities that you can carry forward during the year. There will be some talks, discussion sessions, and project time.  On the second day of the workshop, 
								 atteendees will pitch projects. It's okay if you don't have a project idea, some people with pitch ideas looking for help. So there will be ways you can get involved during the Sprint. Also, we understand with the pandemic and nature of virtual 
								 workshops that you might not be able to attend everything. That's okay, we'll try to post the recorded video the next day and use the virtual tools described below to keep asynchronous attendees informed. </p>
							
							<h3> Code of Conduct </h3>
							<p> All attendees have agreed to and are expected to follow the SSSC Code of Conduct at all times. A copy of the Sprint Code fo Conduct can be found <a href='https://lsst-sssc.github.io/Sprint2022/code_of_conduct.html'>here</a>. </p>  

							<h3> What is Day 0? </h3>
							
							<p> Day 0 is an optioinal day geared for new sprint attendees, new SSSC members, and early career researchers. 
								
							<h3> What do you mean by project? </h3>
							<p> A project can be a wide variety of things, spanng everything from exploring the simulated LSST Solar System database, writing a paper/white paper/AAS Research note draft,  brainstorming a funding proposal idea, learning a new tool, software development, drafting an observing proposal, etc. Basically 
								anything that is going to help you get ready for Day 1 of LSST. We'll have time during Day 1 to brainstorm project ideas, and on Day 2, we'll have time for everyone who wants to lead a project to pitch their project. It's totally okay if you don't have a project idea. If you don't have a project in mind that's okay too, you can join one or more of the projects that are pitched on Day 2. The goal is to get together and spend a few dedicated days making something or learning a new skill that will help get you ready for LSST data. </p>
							</p>
						
						
							<h3> Is there a primer of the expected LSST/Rubin Observatory Solar System Data Products </h3>
							<p> Yes, take a look at the SSSC's <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/dataProds.html">data products webpage </a>, and watch the talk below on Rubin Observatory Data Products </a> from last year's virtual Sprint. </p>

							<h3> What is Wonder? </h3>
							<p> Wonder is a virtual coffee hour. You can enter the Wonder room and join different circles for video chats, form your own circle, or join larger conversations by entering spaces. We'll be using this for our virtual coffee break before the start of the sprint days and for the project breakouts. Feel free to pop in 
				 			during breaks or other times in the Sprint when you want to have 1-on-1 conversations with attendees. </p>
